\chapter{Introduction}

Blockchain is a distributed and decentralized chain of records or ledgers.The immutability of blockchain records ensures trust between participating entities.At its core, blockchain is a distributed
system for recording and storing transaction
records. More specifically, blockchain is a
shared, immutable record of peer-to-peer
transactions built from linked transaction
blocks and stored in a digital ledger.
Blockchain relies on established
cryptographic techniques to allow each
participant in a network to interact (e.g.
store, exchange, and view information),
without preexisting trust between the
parties. In a blockchain system, there is no
central authority; instead, transaction
records are stored and distributed across all
network participants. Interactions with the
blockchain become known to all participants
and require verification by the network
before information is added, enabling
trustless collaboration between network
participants while recording an immutable
audit trail of all interactions.This has lead to a wide range of applications for blockchain on different domains like banking,financial transactions,social media platforms,crypto currencies etc.The impact of blockchain technology can also be seen in the healthcare industry also. Technologists and healthcare providers and professionals across the globe view blockchain technology as a crucial way to implement the sharing of medical records in a secure way to protect patient's personal data from outsiders, and give patients more control over their information.Various blockchain based solutions have been emerged to enhance current situation of healthcare.

\chapter{Problems in Healthcare Sector}

The current healthcare infrastructure has often been called inadequate to handle information exchange and requires certain tweaks.Health record sharing in current scenario doesn't take care about the privacy of patients and patients have less control over their own data.The following is a list of main problems healthcare industry and the patients faces today.
\section{Interoperability of healthcare data}
Currently, there is no accepted standard for the sharing of health data from one hospital to another.Most of the cases, patient has to carry all of his past medical records to the new hospital or have to do the previous medical tests again.It’s difficult to simply copy information from one piece of EHR software to another. Mismatched types, strange data fields, and proprietary formats mean that data has to be manipulated and sanitized before it can be imported into another system. This lack of a common standard for capturing, transmitting, receiving, storing, and managing patient data causes delays and inaccuracies.Some EHR and healthcare system vendors are holding patient data for ransom. They charge fees for transmitting data outside the system, increasing operational costs and making providers less likely to send data to others in the healthcare supply chain. The government is acting to encourage interoperability, but not all vendors have taken this on board.There is no way to consistently identify a patient across multiple systems or providers. Patients can give their name, date of birth, and other identifying data, but because different systems store this information in different ways, errors are possible. There is a push towards a unique patient identifier — a code that could be used to categorically identify the same individual no matter what system or provider they used. Unfortunately, we are still far from getting this most basic of functionalities in place.There is also a lack of standards for sending, receiving, and managing information between EHR systems.

\section{Fragmented patient records}
Patient data is scattered across many hospitals and healthcare service  providers. Patient doesn't have a longitudinal list of his/her past health records.Duplication of health records can occur within hospitals also.Different records may be generated for same patient if he forgets his unique IDs.Many hospitals in rural areas are still following physical records which makes the record handling even complex.The records are more prone to tampering and loss.
Patients regularly encounter fragmented systems of care and the results often lead to unmet social needs, conflicting medications, incorrect dosages etc. Many of patients that are the most affected by fragmented care coordination are populations that are already at-risk for chronic illnesses and have an array of unmet social needs. 
\section{Claim Adjudication}
Current existing patient billing management systems are at best complex and prone to manipulation by the
service providers – today, an estimated 50\% of healthcare costs are fraudulent, resulting from excessive
billing or billing for non-performed services.Also Currently, 20\%[bookchapetr2018] of claims get rejected either because they are not received by the insurer or they contain defects, such as incomplete or incorrect demographic
data or lack of proof supporting the services billed.There is a lack of trust between participants in the healthcare industry as medical records are easily changed by hospitals or patients for getting health insurances.It is easy to tamper the data if it is stored centrally at a place.Currently, twenty-two percent of claims get rejected either because they are not re-
ceived by the insurer or they contain defects, such as incomplete or incorrect demographic
data or lack of proof supporting the services billed.So,it is important to ensure that all
claims submitted for payment are coded accurately.
\section{Data Privacy and Security}
Since patient doesn't has the full control over his data, third parties can easily misuse the data.There are currently no mechanism available to share data in a permissioned and time bound manner.Sensitive data in healthcare can include patient data like protected health information (PHI), stored data such as medical and payment records, medical devices data etc. which are ubiquitous in healthcare environments.But healthcare organizations are not always properly prepared for managing and protecting their big data. That’s because IT departments within healthcare organizations often lack the budget necessary to bolster big data security.Data breaches, like the one that exposed nearly 38 million Anthem Health Insurance patient records, are becoming increasingly common. The healthcare industry has the highest risk factor when it comes to experiencing a data breach. Statistics show 88\% of all ransomware attacks in 2017 targeted the healthcare industry.[https://www.zettaset.com/index.php/solutions/data-privacy-protection-healthcare/].Healthcare records are considered highly valuable to cyber-attackers. This is because of the richness of personal, medical, financial information contained within each EHR. Data thieves can easily resell this information on the dark web. With access to this information, identity theft, insurance fraud, and financial fraud is committed for financial gain by criminal elements.But data is at risk even if an organization does not suffer an outside attack. Information can be leaked internally when employees, contractors, and IT security personnel do not take the proper precautions to manage and protect their data.

\section{Lack of Transparency}
The entire system is not patient centric and patient doesn't have full control over his/her data.Since patient doesnt have control over their data, what happen with their data is hidden to the patient.


\section{Data Reliability}
Health data of patients should be instantly accessible when there is a need.Most of the service providers are storing health data locally in their database.This causes high potential for data reliability and data loss.If the system fails, entire patient health records gets destroyed.Cloud based duplication of data is necessary to reliably store data loss.


\chapter{Blockchain Applications in Healthcare}
There are lots of areas within healthcare where blockchain can be applied.Blockchain can provide patient centric longitudianl health records,supply chain management,permissioned data sharing and a lot more.The following are the main use cases of blockchain in  healthcare.
\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{apps.jpg}
\caption{Personal Health Records}
\label{ppr}
\end{figure}
\section{Personal Health Records}
The architecture of blockchain is like a series of immutable records.This is highly helpful in implementic a patient centric chain of health records.The series of health records of patients can be linked on the basis of time as patient goes for different services at different providers.The following are the different concepts on how to implement this longitudinal list of records.
\subsection{Medrec}
In Medrec, the longitudinal ist of records are implemented using Summery Contracts(SC).This is a special kind of etherium contract which functions as a bread crumb trail for participants in the system to locate their medical record history.It holds a list of references to Patient Provider Relationship contracts (PPRs).A Patient Provider Contract is issued when a service provider like hospital adds health records for a patient.Thus SC represents all the patient's previous and current engagements with other service providers in the system. Providers can also have SC with references to patients for whom they have given services. SC can be used to provide backups, notifications,granting and revoking access permissions etc.

\end{figure}
\section{Health Information Exchange}
Currently, the healthcare industry experiences major inefficiencies due to diverse and unconnected data. Effective care collaboration is vital to improve healthcare outcomes. With digitized health data, the exchange of healthcare information across healthcare organizations is required.Data sharing should be done only by considering privacy of patients.
\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{centric.png}
\caption{lilang 2017}
\label{ppr}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Medicalchain}
Any interactions with health records are recorded as transactions on the network.
Transactions are viewable only to the participants associated with the transaction.Medicalchain follows following procedures for information sharing.
\begin{description}
\item[$\bullet$] Patient A grants access to EHR to Practitioner A
\item[$\bullet$] Practitioner A’s ID is added to Patient A’s authorised asset on the ledger
\item[$\bullet$] Patient A’s ID is added to Practitioner A’s authorised asset on the ledger
\item[$\bullet$] The Symmetric key for the EHR is decrypted with Patient A’s private key
\item[$\bullet$] Symmetric key is then encrypted with Practitioner A’s public key
\end{description}
Similar kind of operations are done for revoking access.

\subsection{Deloitte}
Deloitte uses patients private key to share their health data.Patients private key links their identity to blockchain data.Only oraganisations with this key can access the information and others can not.

\section{Verifying the Authenticity of Drugs}

In the Pharma industry, drugs are frequently returned to the pharmaceutical manufacturers. For instance, wholesalers may have ordered excess inventory and accordingly may need to return unsold stock to the pharmaceutical manufactures.While the proportion of the returned drugs is small compared to the sales (about 2–3\% of sales), the per year volume is in the range of \$7- 10 billion.[https://hackernoon.com/top-5-use-cases-of-blockchain-in-pharma-and-healthcare-that-you-should-know-about-77ccdd76369b]
Instead of destroying these perfectly good drug shipments, pharmaceutical companies instead opt to re-sell them. However before they can re-sell these returned drugs, the pharmaceutical companies have a legal obligation to verify the authenticity of the returned drugs(eg: Falsified Medicine Directive (FMD)).A far better and recommended approach is to have pharmaceutical manufacturers record the serial numbers of their packages on a blockchain, which serves as a decentralized and distributed ledger. Wholesalers and customers can then verify the authenticity of a drug package by connecting to the blockchain.

\subsection{ATTP (Advanced Track and Trace for Pharmaceuticals) by SAP}
Merck in partnership with SAP has developed the SAP Pharma Blockchain POC app. SAP launched this first Proof of Concept in Q3 2017, and an improved version in early 2018.
\begin{description}
\item[$\bullet$]SAP’s existing solution (unrelated to blockchain) generates unique identifiers for a drug package.
\item[$\bullet$]When a manufacturer ships a package they register the item on the SAP Pharma POC blockchain, with the four pieces of information generated; the item number (based on GS1 standard), a serial number, a batch number, and an expiration date.
\item[$\bullet$]The distributor can extract the four pieces information from the packaging’s barcode, using a simple scanner mobile app, allowing them to verify returns .
\item[$\bullet$]Counterfeiter copies of barcodes can be avoided, since SAP has the added ability to track every time a package changes hands. A map view within the mobile app also helps ensure that the drugs are in the expected geographical region.
\end{description}

\subsection{Farmatrust}
is developing a platform based on blockchain technology to improve drug supply chain integrity. It is mainly focused on eliminating of counterfeit drugs proliferation and increasing efficiency in the pharmaceutical industry. The platform offers possibility to track pharmaceuticals through a supply chain that links digital systems to pharmaceuticals moving in the physical world. With a unique ID combined to a digital supply chain the FarmaTrust solution based on blockchain aims to eliminate proliferation of counterfeit drugs.
 
The platform will create a network of pharmaceutical brands, contract manufacturers and suppliers, logistics and shipping companies, wholesalers and distributors as well as pharmacies and hospitals. This network will then become a trusted system to ensure that medicines and related products are indeed the genuine product.

\section{Health Insurance Claim Adjudication}
The insurer may decide to pay the claim in full, deny the claim, or reduce the amount
paid to the provider. The decision to reduce a payment to the provider is typically made when
the insurance company has determined that the billed service is inappropriate or medically
unnecessary for the diagnosis or procedure codes. Therefore, “it is important to ensure that all
claims submitted for payment are coded accurately. As soon as an insurance company re-
ceives a medical claim, they begin a thorough review. Sometimes even small errors such as a
misspelled patient name may cause a claim to be rejected” [57]. The majority of claims today
are processed automatically without manual intervention, but as claims become more com-
plex and are plagued by error and fraud [58], claim adjudication remains a challenging pro-
cess.
Currently, twenty-two percent of claims get rejected either because they are not re-
ceived by the insurer or they contain defects, such as incomplete or incorrect demographic
data or lack of proof supporting the services billed [59].Fortunately, smart contracts present
an opportunity for automating the adjudication process further by distributing and thus mak-
ing claims transparent to the provider and insurer, exposing potential errors and frauds that
can be corrected or investigated in a much timelier manner. Another benefit of creating these
pre-established agreements via smart contracts is to ensure involved participants are up-to-
date and properly notified as policies or rules change.

ing claims transparent to the provider and insurer, exposing potential errors and frauds that
can be corrected or investigated in a much timelier manner

\section{Ensuring trust between providers}
Blockchain's transparent behaviour can ensure trust between parcipating agents.Instead of creating a new trusted “middle man” that mediates the establishment of
trust relationships between providers/hospitals, Blockchain technology offers the opportunity
for trustless exchange and disintermediation that allow existing trust relationships to be ag-
gregated and propagated across various organizations and providers.

\section{Data Reliability}
Under blockchain, data is stored in a replicated manner and each participating node has complete copy of all the transactions.This replicated storage mechanism ensures reliability for stored data.

\chapter{Challenges in Implementation}
Even though there are good reasons behind applying blockchain on healthcare sector,as of now, there are no well established EHR management platform based on blockchain which actually works.There are services under development including Medicalchain,Medrec etc.Big multinational companies like IBM are also investing in blockchain.
